# dvk2m-tetris
Original Tetris on the Soviet DVK2M computer. This is a recreation of it.

The language is Russian (obviously).

Original controls of tetris. You can play it with arrow keys and spacebar or you can play with the original controls:

7:left 8:turn 9:right
5:drop
1:next piece

The scoreboard is WIP.


If you use it somewhere please make sure to credit me
